# 🎉 Real-Time Face Detection App 🎉

Welcome to the Real-Time Face Detection App! This application uses the powerful OpenCV library and Streamlit to detect faces in real-time using your webcam. It's a fun and interactive way to see face detection in action! 👀

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Viola-Jones algorithm
- Adjustable parameters for face detection:
  - Scale Factor
  - Min Neighbors
  - Rectangle Color
- User-friendly interface with Streamlit
- Easy start/stop functionality for face detection

## 📋 Instructions

1. **Adjust Parameters**: Use the sliders to adjust the scale factor and min neighbors for face detection.
2. **Choose Color**: Pick your favorite color for the rectangles around detected faces using the color picker.
3. **Start Detection**: Click the "Detect Faces" button to start detecting faces from your webcam.
4. **Stop Detection**: Click the "Stop Detection" button to stop the face detection.

## 💡 How It Works

The app utilizes OpenCV's `CascadeClassifier` to detect faces in real-time from the webcam feed. The detected faces are highlighted with rectangles whose color, scale factor, and min neighbors can be customized.
